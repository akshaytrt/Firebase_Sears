							<h2>Sears India MD Alok Kumar enlightens industry leaders on Talent Vision 2025</h2>
							<p>Sears India had the honor of being a part of the Vision 2025 event at Indian Institute of Materials Management (IIMM) on 25th April 2015. Vision 2025 was conducted by IIMM at Le Meridien, Pune. Our VP & MD Alok Kumar was invited to give the attendees a talk on 'Managing Scalability through Skills and Talent'.

Alok spoke about several aspects of organization growth and highlighted how skills and talent need to be integrated managed in order to expand while lowering costs at the same time.</p>

"Sears Holdings India focuses on enhancing our members' experience through cutting edge technology. In the last five years, our teams in India have generated immense value for Sears Holdings and its members, and with this expansion, we aim at enhancing this value further," President of Member Technology at Sears Holdings Corporation, Dennis Moore said.</p>
					
					<p>Alok further added, <q>Skilled talent is a necessity for surviving in any industry. Companies today have taken up onus of retaining talent through upskilling opportunities. The supply chain management plays a very important role in the scalability of talent. Citing pertinent examples like that of Nokia that could not keep up with changing mobility trends, Alok also shared various innovative HR practices that Sears India has pioneered in its 5 years of existence.</q>

Students and supply chain industry leaders appreciated the wealth of knowledge that Alok brought in.</p>
